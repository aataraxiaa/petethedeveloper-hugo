[Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is invaluable in helping us to identify problems early in the development cycle, both in terms of the implementation and the specification. It also facilitates change, providing confidence that any future changes to the tested code won’t break it’s expected behaviour.
 
Key to unit testing is [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage), which indicates what % of the tested code was executed when the corresponding unit tests were run. Ideally, good unit tests would result in 100% code coverage. That is, 100% of the target code was executed when the corresponding unit tests were run. 

Xcode 7 [introduced](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/07-code_coverage.html) a code coverage feature which allows us to measure and visualize code coverage.

In this short post, we will learn;

* How to measure code coverage in Xcode
* How to increase code coverage

For the purposes of demonstration, we will look at the unit tests for [BikeProvider](https://github.com/superpeteblaze/BikeProvider), a tiny Swift library I created to provide access to bike share information.
