#### Me
I'm Pete, an engineer & iOS developer. I have worked in software since 2011, and have been developing iOS apps since 2013.
I am currently in a loving relationship with Swift, but of course still find time for my old flame Obj-C.

I love building things, and I am always toying with new ideas. My latest app is [Bikey](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/bikey/id1048962300?mt=8).
